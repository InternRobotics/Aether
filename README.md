Aether addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: integrating geometric reconstruction with generative modeling 
for human-like spatial reasoning. Our framework unifies three core capabilities: (1) üåè **4D dynamic reconstruction**, 
(2) üé¨ **action-conditioned video prediction**, and (3) üéØ **goal-conditioned visual planning**. Trained entirely on 
synthetic data, Aether achieves strong zero-shot generalization to real-world scenarios.

## :hammer: Installation

Note: We recommend using virtual environments such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

```console
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/Aether.git
cd Aether

# create conda environment
conda create -n aether python=3.10
conda activate aether

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## :rocket: Inference

> ***Warning***: When doing reconstruction, Aether pipeline automatically centers crop the input video if its size does not match 480x720. 
Therefore, for evaluation purpose, we have to slide a 480p window both on the spatial and temporal dimensions, 
and blend all windows' outputs both spatially and temporally. Examples of video depth and camera pose evaluation can be found at [evaluation/](evaluation/).

### Run inference demo locally

- 4D reconstruction:
  ```console
  python scripts/demo.py --task reconstruction --video ./assets/example_videos/moviegen.mp4
  ```

- Action-conditioned video prediction:
  ```console
  python scripts/demo.py --task prediction --image ./assets/example_obs/car.png --raymap_action assets/example_raymaps/raymap_forward_right.npy
  ```

- Goal-conditioned visual planning:
  ```console
  python scripts/demo.py --task planning --image ./assets/example_obs_goal/01_obs.png --goal ./assets/example_obs_goal/01_goal.png
  ```

Results will be saved in `./outputs/` by default.

### Run inference demo with Gradio

The Gradio demo provides an interactive web-based Aether experience.

```shell
python scripts/demo_gradio.py
```

Our local testing environment is deployed using an A100 GPU with 80GB of memory, and it is set to run on the local port 7860 by default.

### Inference with your own raymap action

Suppose you have a sequence of camera poses, you have to convert it to raymap action trajectories before inference with Aether. 
Note that your camera poses should be **within the camera coordinate system of the first frame**.
You can use the `camera_pose_to_raymap` function in [postprocess_utils.py](aether/utils/postprocess_utils.py).

```python
# suppose you have the ground-truth depth values:
disparity = 1. / depth[depth > 0]
dmax = disparity.max()
# otherwise, you can set dmax to 1.0 by default:
dmax = 1.0

# then suppose we have a camera trajectory
# camera_pose: shape of (N, 4, 4), e.g. N = 41
# intrinsic: shape of (N, 3, 3), e.g. N = 41
from aether.utils.postprocess_utils import camera_pose_to_raymap

# we will get a raymap sequence of shape (N, 6, h, w) 
# where h = image height // 8 and w = image width // 8
raymap = camera_pose_to_raymap(camera_pose=camera_pose, intrinsic=intrinsic, dmax=dmax)

# save the raymap
np.save("/path/to/your/raymap.npy", raymap)
```

## :bulb: Limitations

Aether represents an initial step in our journey, trained entirely on synthetic data. While it demonstrates promising capabilities, it is important to be aware of its current limitations:

- üîÑ Aether struggles with highly dynamic scenarios, such as those involving significant motion or dense crowds.
- üì∏ Its camera pose estimation can be less stable in certain conditions.  
- üìê For visual planning tasks, we recommend keeping the observations and goals relatively close to ensure optimal performance.  

We are actively working on the next generation of Aether and are committed to addressing these limitations in future releases.
